Clickster Game

I started by making sure I can render the images from my superHero.json data, to the page.  Once I got that going, I made sure that the onClick function worked in the console log.  My trouble came when I tried to add a function to my onClick.  It wouldn't do what I was trying to make it do in the clickedImage function, and was then stating that my superHeros.map function wasn't working.  I tried to debug this for a few hours, and got frustrated.
