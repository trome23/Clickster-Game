Clickster Game

A Super-Hero memory type game using React! 

Once you have cloned the repo, you just need to run NPM install in your terminal, when in this folder.  It should then open up in your browser.

To play, you will click a Super Hero of your liking!  They will then shuffle, and you must remember the Super Hero you chose, and remember NOT to choose them again.  Try to get the highest score by selecting each Super Hero only once:)
