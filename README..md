Clickster Game

I started by making sure I can render the images from my superHero.json data, to the page.  Once I got that going, I made sure that the onClick function worked in the console log.  My trouble came when I tried to add a function to my onClick.  It wouldn't do what I was trying to make it do in the clickedImage function, and was then stating that my superHeros.map function wasn't working.  I tried to debug this for a few hours, and got frustrated.

I came back the next day and simplified my logic, and tried to get the assignment requirements done one by one rather than all together.  I removed the Wrapper, but then had to add it back to make the images fit appropriately.  I got it to work and added basic CSS to make it look decent.
